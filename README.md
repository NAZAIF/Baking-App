# Baking-App

Android Baking app that shows you some of the good recipes for cooking.
The credit for the recipes are to Udacity's Baker in chief, **Miriam**.

The user can select a recipe and see video-guided steps on how to complete it.
Donâ€™t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.

This project is developed as part of Android Developer Nanodegree by Udacity.


### Install

Simply clone and run to enjoy the recipe. 

Remember, this app runs on **Android N+** devices (Mobiles & Tablets)

Give the recipes a try out!

### What I Learnt from Project

- Found and handled error cases
- Added a **widget** to the app experience. Don't forget to check it out ;-)
- Espresso UI testing
- Added the library [Exoplayer](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/exoplayer) to display videos.
- Added 3rd party library [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) to display images.
- Used Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
